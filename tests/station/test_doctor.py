"""railctl doctor: checks D0-D12 and the verdict block.

Every scripted scenario here uses a `Responder` keyed by exact request bytes,
never `FakeTransport.expect()`'s ordered queue: `run_probe` sends a variable
number of exchanges depending on which capability path each check takes, and
pinning that count would break the moment an unrelated internal refactor
changed it. `Responder` distinguishes two kinds of answer: a PERSISTENT one
(the same reply every time a request recurs - `station.status()` is called
more than once in a single `run_probe`, and both calls must see the same
track-power bit unless a test explicitly changes it) and a QUEUED one (answer
this exact request once, then fall back to whatever is persistent or
default - later checks in this project send the identical `21 10 31` poll
telegram for several different CVs in a row, and each must get its own answer
in turn).

    on_write is handed the FRAMED request, and every table in this class is keyed on bare

    make every lookup miss and every probe answer GENERIC_ACK - a doctor that measures nothing
    and reports success.

    D4 through D8 all poll the identical `21 10` service-result telegram inside one run_probe, and
    the station answers a given CV on the same ident+echo bytes regardless of which opcode asked
    for it (`docs/probe-results.md`: CV8 always comes back on `63 14 08`, whether POM, a direct
    service read, or an extended service read asked) - so a queue keyed on the poll telegram
    alone cannot tell one check's poll from another's, and cannot even fall back to matching on
    the reply's own bytes, since a reply that would satisfy one check's matcher can equally
    satisfy a different check's matcher for the same CV. `queue_once_for` scopes a reply to the
    request that must immediately precede the poll it answers - tracked here as `_last_probe`,
    the most recent DIFFERENT request this responder has seen - so a reply queued for one check's
    poll stays invisible to every other check's.
